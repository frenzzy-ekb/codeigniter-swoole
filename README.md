Abstract-Swoole

This simple package is combind with CodeIgniter.

So that we can use Swoole in a single CI framework.

Normally we only want to start a single server side in CLI,

but connect with multi client side. abstract-swoole is the one.

Detail useage see the demo directory, if you formiliar with

CI.

Before start the server side, you should make sure has swoole installed

aready, and of course CI required.

CLI Commond:> cd <to your ci directory>
CLI Commond:> php index.php swoole start

That's all, @end, sorry about my english.
